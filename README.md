# Health-care-analytics-with-Apache-cassandra

The objective of this project is to build a strong data infrastructure using Apache Cassandra that improves effective data tracking and provides centrally distributed data security.For applications like patient monitoring, where data needs to be processed and analyzed fast to offer immediate insights into patient health, Cassandra's capacity to manage massive volumes of data in real -time is especially crucial.
For our project, we have made use of React js for the frontend side and Node js on the backend. We have also made use of HTML and CSS for formatting purposes.To load data and perform operations we have made use of Cqlsh provided by Astra DB.
